                        I'm an attorney and I hired Naomi to help with estate planning. She was extremely knowledgeable, helpful,
                        and patient.  I appreciated how thorough and thoughtful she was and have recommended her services to
                        friends. I would use her services again without question.

                        After years of procrastinating the writing of my will, I heard that Naomi Littlefield was available to help with
                        wills and trusts. Ms. Littlefield was a delight to work with as she guided me through the process of creating a
                        trust.  She brought structure and a timeline to the process which I badly needed, was very responsive, and
                        kept things moving smoothly.  As a GHI member she knew what GHI would require to approve a trust which
                        also was very helpful. She made what had seemed to me to be an overwhelming process doable. I highly
                        recommend her.

                        When I relocated to Maryland after the passing of my husband, I was dreading having to
                        update my will. Naomi Littlefield made the process stress-free. At our first meeting, she
                        was prepared with a step-by-step handout highlighting the information I needed to
                        provide. She addressed my questions in a professional and yet caring manner. What
                        could have been a cumbersome and nerve-wracking situation was neither because of
                        Ms. Littlefield's calm and professional manner. I would highly recommend her estate
                        planning services to family and friends.

                        Thank you, Naomi, for your guidance in preparing all the necessary documents to ensure a smooth transfer to
                        my heirs when the time comes.  I have put it off for years, as I was unsure of what documents were needed
                        and how to get them processed.
                        Even after hearing stories that delays in transferring assets after death can cause personal emotional
                        hardships and unnecessary financial hardships, I still put off the task. Then one phone call to Naomi started
                        the ball rolling.  Naomi asked all the right questions, answered all my questions and sent me forms to help me
                        put my plans in writing.  After I had time to consider my options, we met to review my decisions.Â  When
                        Naomi completed all the documents, we met again to execute the documents.
                        I feel such a sense of relief to have finally completed all these important documents.  I truly appreciate all the
                        time, effort, patience, knowledge and experience that it took to get the job done.  Again, thank you, Naomi,
                        for helping me, and I certainly will recommend you to all that need this same service.
                    </p>
