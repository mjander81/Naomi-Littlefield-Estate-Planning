        Estate planning empowers you to make important decisions for yourself, such as who will inherit 
        your property and who will make decisions for you if you are unable to make them for yourself.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, hours and dollars spent making your estate easier to manage could save your loved ones 
        much more time and money, at a difficult period for them to have extra work that could have 
        been avoided.
