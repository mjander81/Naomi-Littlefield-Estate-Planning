                <h3>Estate Planning Basics</h3>    
                <p>
                    Regardless of unique circumstances, I recommend everyone at least take the following steps:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Designate beneficiaries on accounts, life insurance, and vehicles </li>
                    <li>Prepare and sign a will, financial power of attorney, and advance directive for health</li>
                    <li>Consider using a revocable living trust to avoid probate</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <h3>Benefits of Beneficiary Designations</h3>
                <p>
                    Beneficiary designations enable an asset to pass to a beneficiary upon your death without
                    going through <a href="#probate">probate</a>, which is a complex and often costly legal process.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    You can designate one or more beneficiary or payable upon death name on bank accounts,
                    stock and investment accounts, retirement accounts, and life insurance. If you own a vehicle
                    that does not have a loan, you can also designate a beneficiary for the vehicle through the
                    Maryland Department of Transportation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Benefits of a Having Will</h3>
                <p>
                    Having a will enables you to:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Appoint the legal guardian for your minor child or children</li>
                    <li>Appoint the person who will administer your probate estate</li>
                    <li>Determine who will inherit assets in your probate estate (within the limits of the
                        <a href="#augmented">augmented spousal election share</a>)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If you do not have a will when you die, the <a href="#intestacy-laws">Maryland laws of intestacy</a> will determine who has
                    priority to serve as your personal representative and who will inherit your probate assets.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Benefits of Having a Financial Power of Attorney Document</h3>
                <p>
                    A Financial Power of Attorney Document will allow someone else to step in and manage your
                    finances in the event that you are not able to manage them yourself. In the case of a medical
                    emergency, it is much better to have this prepared in advance versus trying to complete it
                    while in a hospital. Also, some people temporarily or permanently lose the mental capacity to
                    complete the document, so it is good to complete it well in advance of there being any risk of
                    that happening.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Benefits of Having an Advance Directive for Health</h3>
                <p>
                    An Advance Directive for Health will allow someone else to make medical decisions for you in
                    the event that you are not able to make them for yourself. In addition to designating the
                    person who has the legal right to do this for you, the document enables you to express your
                    desires for care (a) when death is imminent and also (b) in the event you are in a persistent
                    vegetative state.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Benefits of Putting Real Estate in a Revocable Living Trust</h3>
                <p>
                    Putting your home and any other real property that you own into a revocable living trust prior
                    to your death would likely save the person managing your estate after your death a lot of time
                    and also make the administration of your estate much less expensive. A revocable living trust
                    enables a successor trustee to transfer the ownership of your property, upon your death and
                    pursuant to your instructions, without having to go through <a href="#probate">probate</a>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When a person puts their property into a revocable living trust for the purpose of estate
                    planning, what they are doing from a technical legal perspective is changing the ownership of
                    the property from conventional ownership to owning the property as a trustee, for their own
                    benefit during their life-time, and for the benefit of their beneficiaries upon their death. The
                    word “revocable” in revocable living trust means that the person who put the property in the
                    trust can take the property out of the trust.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 id="probate">Probate: Why does it make sense to keep property out of probate?</h3>
                <p>
                    Probate is the distribution of property pursuant to a will or under the Maryland laws of
                    intestacy. It is a formal legal process overseen by Maryland's Orphan's court. The first step in
                    the probate process is the person appointed as your personal representative in your will must
                    petition the Court to formally be appointed to serve as your personal representative. There
                    are several additional steps that must be taken before your probate estate can be distributed.
                    If your personal representative is not a resident of the state of Maryland, they must designate
                    an in-state agent. A personal representative is entitled to about 4% of the probate estate as
                    compensation for serving in this role. Because probate is complex, a personal representative
                    often has an attorney assist. Typically, an attorney will charge at least half of the amount that
                    the personal representative is entitled to, which results in the attorney receiving about 2% of
                    the probate estate. Keeping property out of probate will save your loved ones both time and
                    money.

                <p>
                    Maryland laws of intestacy: What happens if you die without a will?
                    If you do not have a will when you die, the Maryland laws of intestacy will determine who has
                    priority to serve as your personal representative and who will inherit your probate assets.
                    Here is how your probate estate will be distributed:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Spouse and minor children:</b> Spouse receives one-half and children share the remaining
                        one-half.</li>
                    <li><b>Spouse and adult children:</b> Spouse receives $40,000 plus one-half of remaining estate,
                        children divide balance with the interest of a predeceased child passing to issue of that
                        child.</li>
                    <li><b>Children only:</b> Children (does not include step-children) divide entire estate with the
                        interest of a predeceased child passing to issue of that child.</li>
                    <li><b>Spouse and parents:</b> If married less than five years, spouse receives $40,000 plus one-half
                        of remaining estate and parents divide balance or surviving parent takes balance. If married
                        more than 5 years, see #5.</li>
                    <li><b>Spouse of the decedent without other heirs listed above:</b> Spouse receives entire estate.</li>
                    <li><b>Parents of the decedent without other heirs listed above:</b> Parents divide entire estate or
                        surviving parent takes all.</li>
                    <li><b>Siblings of the decedent without heirs listed above:</b> Siblings divide estate equally, with the
                        share of a deceased sibling going to their issue.</li>
                    <li><b>Grandparents without other heirs listed above:</b> Grandparents divide entire estate or, if
                        deceased, to their issue.</li>
                    <li><b>Great-grandparent without other heirs listed above:</b> Great-grandparents divide entire
                        estate or, if deceased, to their issue.</li>
                    <li><b>Step-children:</b> If there are no heirs listed above, step-children divide estate equally.</li>
                    <li><b>No living heirs or step-children:</b> If decedent was a recipient of long-term care benefits
                        under the Maryland Medical Assistance Program at time of death, net estate is paid to
                        Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Otherwise, the net estate is paid to the Board
                        of Education.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <h3 id="augmented">Augmented spousal election share: How does marriage impact estate distribution?</h3>
                <p>
                    Regardless of what your will and beneficiary designations provide, Maryland law allows a
                    surviving spouse to claim one-third of your estate if you have surviving children or one-half if
                    you do not have surviving children. This election applies to your entire estate, not just your
                    probate estate, although courts do have discretion to exclude assets based on the nature of
                    the marital relationship. The spousal election share can be waived through a prenuptial or
                    postnuptial agreement.
